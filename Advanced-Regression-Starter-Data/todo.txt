1. For the months, and day relationship graphs, use facets in matplotlib or seaborn for graphs
In the legends, state the months, or hours, or day names
use a different seaborn color palette
for hours, use line graphs
seville pressure: the plot is disorganized. revisit it. so many legends. what to do?????
correlation: correlate only to load shortfall. all the predictors to only the response because they are too many.
